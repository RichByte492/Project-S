Finance Manager (Fully equipped for budgeting) 

# Wave Financial Manager

Wave Financial Manager is a simple web application that helps users manage their personal finances. It allows users to track income, expenses, and budgets, and provides visual charts to analyze their financial data.

## Features

* Add income sources and amounts
* Add expense categories and amounts
* Set budgets for different categories
* View income vs expenses chart
* View expense categories chart
* View summary of total balance, monthly income, and monthly expenses

## Development

The development of Wave Financial Manager  ( this included some time to master the chart js library and working on the css parts for good UI look ). The application was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following libraries were used:

* Chart.js for creating charts
* Font Awesome for icons

The development process involved creating the HTML structure, styling the application using CSS, and writing JavaScript code for handling user input, storing data, and displaying charts.

## Usage

To use Wave Financial Manager, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The application does not require any server-side processing, so it can be run locally.

## End notes
I hope this webapp is quite functional and with a good ui that is comfortable for most of you (Blue themed so some of you might not like it that much )
